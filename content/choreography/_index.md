Here you can see a 10min extract of the original output data of the neuronal network that was developed for Deep.Dance. In the rehearsal process the dancers used this tool - with a few addons - to learn and transcribe the movements of their figure. Each dancer developed an own approach of how to translate nearly sixty minutes of fairly random movement into an audio transcript. All movements of the AI figures were translated into a personal audio code, with countdowns, spoken images, directions an rhythical sounds. In the end it was synchronized to the original timing of the AI choreography and each dancers would listen to the audio during the live performance - in that way, a most accurate interpretation of the AI choreography was possible.
